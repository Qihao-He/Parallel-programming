Figuring out how to use the ./hello_fft.bin
Usage: hello_fft.bin log2_N [jobs [loops]]
log2_N = log2(FFT_length),       log2_N = 8...22
jobs   = transforms per batch,   jobs>0,        default 1

Page360 FFT
Algorithm with complexity O(n*log(n)) exits and it is amenable to
parallelization.
To evaluate f(x), a polynomial of degree n where n is a power of 2, the
algorithm defines two new polynomials of degree n/2. Function f[0](x) contains
the elements of f(x) associated with the even power of x, while function f[1](x)
contains the elements associated with the odd powers of x.
Note that f(x)=f[0](x^2)+x*f[1](x^2)
So the problem of evaluating f(x) at the points omega n 0,...omega n (n-1)
reduces to evaluating f[0] and f[1] at (omega n 0)^2, (omega n 1)^2...
(omega n n/2-1)^2, then computing f(x)=f[0](x^2)+x*f[1](x^2).

 Halving Lemma
 If n is an even positive number, then the squares of the n complex nth roots of
 units are identical to the n/2 complex (n/2)th roots of unity.

Each agglomerated task(process) is represented by a gray rectangle. Every
process controls two arrays of complex values. The first array, a, contains a
contiguous group of input coefficients. The second array, y, holds intermediate
values. At the end of the computation, array y contains a contiguous group of
transformed values.
3 phases in the parallel algorithm
1.processes permute the a's. all-to-all communication.
2.processes perform the first log(n)-log(p) iterations of the FFT by performing
the required *+-
3.the processes perform the final log(p) iterations of the FFT by swapping y's
and performing the requisite *+-.

Page 365 Agglomeration and Mapping
Think of the processes as being organized as a logical hypercube.
During each of the final log(p) iterations, pairs of processes swap values
across a different dimension of the hypercube.

Isoefficiency Analysis
Each process perform an equal share of the computations. Since the computational
complexity of the sequential algorithm is O(nlog(n)), the computational
complexity of the parallel algorithm is O(nlog(n/p)).
Each process controls at most [n/p] elements of a.

14:50PM
Communication complexity
The all-to-all communication step is implemented as a series of swaps across
each hypercube dimension; it has time complexity O[(n/p)log(p)]. There are
log(p) iterations in which each process swaps about n/p values with a partner
process along one of the hypercube dimensions. The total time complexity of
these swaps is O[(n/p)log(p)]. With these assumption, the overall communication
complexity of the algorithm is O[(n/p)log(p)].
Isoefficiency of the parallel program.
The sequenrtial algorithm has time complexity O[nlog(n)]. The parallel overhead
is p times the communication complexity.
The isoefficiency function is: Page 365
The scalability of the FFT algorithm is similar to the scalability of the
hyper-quicksort and PSRS algorithms.
Page 366 Figure 15.7 The implement of n-element FFT on a p-process multicomputer
so that at the beginning of the computation every process contains a contiguous
set of input element, and at the end of the computation every process contains a
contiguous set of output elements.
Again: 3 phases in the parallel algorithm are shown.
1. Permutation of the input elements, all to all communication.
2. The first logn-logp iterations of the FFT require no communication
3. The last logp iterations require that every process swap copies of its values
with a process adjacent across some dimension of a hypercube.

15.6 SUMMARY
1. DFT is important.
2. FFT is interesting for 2 reasons:
  (a)it is a O(nlog(n)) implementation of the DFT comparing with the naive
  O(n^2).
  (b) FFT is amenable to parallelization.

Reading gpu_fft.txt
https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland/blob/master/host_applications/linux/apps/hello_pi/hello_fft/gpu_fft.txt
INTRODUCTION
GPU_FFT is an FFT library for the pi which exploits the BCM2835 SoC 3D hardware
to deliver 10 times more data throughput than is possible on the pi 1. Kernels
are provided for all power-of-2 FFT lengths between 2^8(256B) to 2^22(4KB). A
transpose function, which also uses the 3D hardware, is provided to support 2D
transforms.

QUESTION: If the RAM run out easily at the 2^22, I think the PI has 4G of RAM?
FACT: PI2 B has 1GB RAM. PI 3Like the Pi 2, it also has: 1GB RAM.
Answer: So running the job of 2^22 is taking 2^8(256B) to 2^22(4KB)?

ACCURACY
GPU_FFT uses single-precision floats for data and twiddle factors.
The relative root-mean-square (rms) error in parts-per-million (ppm) for
different transform lengths (N) is typically:
Accuracy has improved significantly over previous releases at the expense of a
small (2%) performance hit; however, FFTW is still one order of magnitude more
accurate than GPU_FFT.
Fastest Fourier Transform in the West (FFTW) is a software library for computing
discrete Fourier transforms.

8:00PM
THROUGHPUT
Use of "mailbox". It uses the mailbox for longer jobs to avoid busy waiting at
100% CPU for too long; GPU_FFT now avoids this 100us overhead by poking GPU
registers directly from the ARM if total batch runtime will be short.

Typical per-transform runtimes for batch size of 1 and 10;

QUESTIONS: What are the FFTW(FFTW_MEASURE mode) on a Pi 1 with L2 cache enabled
runtime comparing to? Is it batch size 1 or 10?

API FUNCTIONS
gpu_fft_prepare()
gpu_fft_execute()
gpu_fft_release()

PARAMETERS
int mb  MAILBOX file descriptor
int log2_N  log2(FFT length)=8-22
int direction FFT direction: forward FFT and inverse FFT
int jobs  Number of transform in batch=1 or more
GPU_FFT **  Output parameter from prepare: control structure
GPU_FFT * Input parameter to execute and release

DATA FORMAT
Data structure created for
Complex data array storage, REAL AND IMAGINARY, pointers to the input and
output arrays, executing a batch of transforms, buffer pointers are obtained.

DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND:
When executing a batch of transforms, buffer pointers are obtained as follows:

struct GPU_FFT *fft = gpu_fft_prepare( ... , jobs);
 for (int j=0; j<jobs; j++) {
    struct GPU_FFT_COMPLEX *in  = fft->in  + j*fft->step;
    struct GPU_FFT_COMPLEX *out = fft->out + j*fft->step;

GPU_FFT.step is greater than FFT length because a guard space is left between
buffers for caching and alignment reasons.

ping-pong buffers
GPU_FFT performs multiple passes between ping-pong buffers.
________________________________________________________________________________
3/10/2017
10:00AM
data buffer: a region of a physical memory storage used to temporarily store
data while it is being moved from one place to another.
buffer pointers are void pointer
As the ping-pong buffer means, the final output lands in the same buffer as
input after an even number of passes. Transforms where log2_=12...16 use an odd
number of passes and  the final result is left out-of-place. The input data is
never preserved.

EXAMPLE PROGRAM
It accepts 3 optional command-line arguments:<log2_N> <batch> <loops>.

The special character device is required for the ioctl mailbox through which the
 ARM communicates with the Videocore GPU.

QUESTIONS: What is ioctl mailbox?
The intersection of the ARM communicates with the Videocore GPU. In computing,
ioctl (an abbreviation of input/output control) is a system call for
device-specific input/output operations and other operations which cannot be
expressed by regular system calls.

What is this special character device?

WITH OPEN GL on Pi 1
GPU_FFT and Open GL will run concurrently on Pi 1 if GPU_FFT is configured not
to use VC4 L2 cache by zeroing a define in file gpu_fft_base.c.

#define GPU_FFT_USE_VC4_L2_CACHE 0 // Pi 1 only: cached=1; direct=0

QUESTION: CACHED=1;DIRECT=0; What is the difference between the cached and
direct?

Overall performance will probably be higher if GPU_FFT and Open GL take turns at
using the 3D hardware. Since eglSwapBuffers() returns immediately without
waiting for rendering, call glFlush() and glFinish() afterwards as follows:
glFinish() //wait until v3D hardware is idle
...
gpu_fft_execute(...);//blocking call

13:00PM
QUESTION: What is the 3D hardware that is being used?
What is non-blocking call and blocking call?
What is V3D hardware, and why there has to be wait until it is idle?
It should be 3D hardware.

2D FFT
hello_fft_2d demo source,
hello_fft_2d.bin
generate a windows BMP file:"hello_fft_2d.bmp"

QUESTION: What should Mac Linux do aside from Windows file?

Demo uses a 512^2 array; rectangular arrays are allowed.
gpu_fft_trans.c
ptr.arm.uptr[6] = src->x < dst->y? src->x : dst->y;
ptr.arm.uptr[7] = src->y < dst->x? src->y : dst->x;

One may transpose the output from the second FFT pass back into the first pass
input buffer, by preparing and executing a second transposition; however, this
is probably unnecessary.  It depends on how the final output will be accessed.

CONCLUSION OF THE INCREASING TRANSFORMS PER BATCH
We can see that the rel_rms_err has improved as the number of transforms per
batch increased. However, as the number of the transform per batch reaching to
the limit that would cause the OUT OF MEMORY, the rate of the accuracy
improvement of the rel_rms_err is decreasing. It has a twist when the number of
transforms per batch reach 2048, the error increased dramatically.
Also each time the number increase to double than the previous one, the time has
been doubled too.
1. Number of transform per batch *2, total time * 2.
2. Number of transform per batch increases, accuracy increases, until MAX GPU
MEM, inverse.

QUESTION:
What kind of transform is it doing?

DFT

16:07PM
The magnitude squared of the Fourier coefficients , |F(m)|2, is called the
power. Power Spectrum- A plot of the power vs. frequency is referred to as the
power spectrum.
Power spectra for Square signal and for Gaussian Signal.
Signal, Normalized Power.

numpy.fft Module
Function:
fft(s) forward DFT and returns the coefficient F,
ifft(F) the inverse DFT and returns the signal s,
fftfreq(n,d) computes the natural frequencies/wavenumbers. d is an optional
sample spacing.

NATURAL FREQUENCY: The frequency at which a system tends to oscillate in the
absence of any driving or damping force.
Wavenumbers: In the physical sciences, the wavenumbers is the spatial frequency
of a wave, either in cycles per unit distance or radians per unit distance.
fftshift(F) shifts the zero frequency to the center o f the array.

The numpy.fft.fft() Function
The fft.fft() function accepts either a real or a complex array as an input
argument, and returns a complex array of the same size that contains the Fourier coefficients.
For the returned complex array:
â€“ The real part contains the coefficients for the cosine terms.
â€“ The imaginary part contains the negative of the coefficients for the sine
terms.
NOTE: This is exactly what forward Fourier transform is doing.

14:31PM
IMPORTANT NOTICE!!! There are different definitions for how a DFT should be
taken.
Fourier coefficients
F(m) forward transform, is the spectral coefficient for the mth wave component.
F(m) is always complex-valued.
f(n) inverse transform, is value of function f at grid point n. f(n) maybe real
or complex-valued.
NumPy actually uses these equations.
This means that NumPyâ€™s Fourier coefficients will be N times larger than
expected!
QUESTION: Why are the equation deferent with the previous ones? And why is that
1/N change in F(m) and f(n) shows that Fourier coefficients are N times larger
than expected.

fft.fftfreq() function
The natural frequencies associated with the spectral coefficients are calculated
using the fft.fft() function.
The zeroth frequency is first, followed by the positive frequencies in ascending
 order, and then the negative frequencies in descending order.

Reading the program file: fft-example.py
FFT result has RE, IM, |Fk|^2 three graphs.
FFT leakage:
1. There is no limits on the number of data points when taking FFTs in NumPy.
2. The FFT algorithm is much more efficient if the number of data points is a
 power of 2 (128, 512, 1024, etc.).
3. The DFT assumes that the signal is periodic on the interval 0 to N, where N
 is the total number of data points in the signal.
4. Care needs to be taken to ensure that all waves in the signal are periodic
 within the interval 0 to N, or a phenomenon known as leakage will occur.

fft.rfft() Function
Since for real input the negative frequencies are redundant, there is an
fft.rfft() function that only computes the positive coefficients for a real
input.

QUESTION: What is real input? Does the real input means the real part or the
actual input? Why is the nagative frequencies are redundant?

The negative frequencies: The concept of negative and positive frequency can be
as simple as a wheel rotating one way or the other way: a signed value of
frequency can indicate both the rate and direction of rotation.

The helper routine fftfreq() only returns the frequencies for the complex FFT.
It is different for even and odd cases, the frequencies are different.
21:30PM
NOTE:

with the parallel programming using the hello-fft. There should be applied with
the same precision level.

Need to know about NumPy more. And also need to dig into the NumPy and the .fft
module.
NumPy is an extension to the Python programming language, adding support for

Reference from the book Parallel Program DESIGN
Understand the butterfly patterns of the data.
The iterative algorithm can be derive directly from Figure 15.4. After an
initial permutation step, the algorithm will iterate logn times. Each iteration
corresponds to a horizontal layer in Figure 15.4c. Within an iteration the
algorithm updates values for  each of the n indices. The time complexity is the
same as the recursive algorithm O(nlogn). The use of temporary variable t cuts
the number of complex number multiplications nearly in half.

read the hello_fft
I wonder if I am using the program correctly. Check the usage.

$hello_fft.bin 8 [4[2]]
/* if this would be right $hello_fft.bin log2_N jobs loops */

This is the correct input method, see 3/27/2017 notes.

Find that lost connection of raspberrypi. Can not compile and run code
temporarily.

BS NOTE:
Should allow more time for the experiment to run for measuring the energy. The
time increases from 1 second to the log2_N=22 last about 60 seconds, so the main
focus should be on one or a few calculation that would show visible difference.
Also as the calculation increases size, the memory is used up for the matrix
size increases in exponential way.

Dig in the program.
Dig in the header file gpu_fft.h
mailbox.c mailbox.h

Have question where does the API function it is calling from: gpu_fft_prepare()
Also find that the results listing in the blog reference from:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/accelerating-fourier-transforms-using-the-gpu/
is giving the Speedup.

Along with the results showing in the reference:

   Points	   batch=1	   batch=10	   batch=50	   FFTW	   Speedup
   256	112	22	16	92	5.8x
   512	125	37	26	217	8.3x
   1024	136	54	45	482	10.7x
   2048	180	107	93	952	10.2x
   4096	298	256	240	3002	12.5x
   8192	689	624	608	5082	8.4x
   16384	1274	1167	1131	12005	10.6x
   32768	3397	3225	3196	31211	9.8x
   65536	6978	6703	6674	82769	12.4x
   131072	16734	16110	16171	183731	11.4x

These are the time measure for the time-old and time-new that gives out the
speedup. As the points of calculation increases, the speedup of changing the
batch size from 1 to 10 to 50 is not making the typical per-transform runtimes
in microseconds changes a lot.

QUESTION: What does the column difference in batch=1,10,50 means. With the FFTW
 Fastest Fourier Transform in the West (FFTW). From the results shows:
 the Speedup increases to 12.5x peak at 4096 points.

Also read in the results of the gpu_fft.txt:

In the gpu_fft.txt, the accuracy part is describing the RMS root mean square in
PPM parts-per-million, which is pretty accurate.
In the throughput section:
All times in milliseconds 2 significant figures:
That shows the time cost of running the program comparing with the FFTW, which
is significantly shorter than the FFTW.
QUESTION: Why is the Batch size only differ in 1 and 10 form? Why is any number
that is between these two number is not measured?

QUESTION: Why is the using more batch is taking more time?
NOTE: "usecs", (microseconds), "rel_rms_err",(relative root mean square error) k
